# Numerical Solutions of Differential Equations Projects

In the course Numerical Solutions of Differential Equations Projects of 2019 spring, three projects
should be finished in order to complete the course. I give codes and reports of the three projects 
in this repository.


## Project 1
The first project is concerning **finite difference method**.
What I mainly did was using **finite difference method** to give numerical solution of heat conduction equation under 
**Dirichlet** and **Neumann** boundary conditions.

## Project 2
The second project is about **finite volume method** and the grids used to implement 
scheme, to be specific, **vertex centered grids** and **cell centered grids**.
I implemeted finite volume schemes with different grids to test the performances of varied 
schemes for a particular partial differential equations under **Dirichlet** and **Neumann** boundary conditions.


## Project 3
The third project is about **Riemann problem for inviscid Burger's equation**.
I used four different schemes, **Lax-Friedrichs, Lax-Wendroff, Godunov and Beam-Warming**,
to give numerical solution of the Riemann problem for inviscid Burger's equation and tested the 
performances of the four schemes under different time steps and space steps.

### Note
The comments of the codes are given in reports. Also,
the reports are in Chinese right now. I will update the English version as soon as possible.
